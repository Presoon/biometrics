##### Common types of biometrics:

- Fingerprints

- Photo and video

- Physiological recognition

- Voice

- Signature

- DNA


##### Uncommon types:

- Typing patterns

- Physical movements

- Navigation patterns

- Engagement patterns


##### How reliable is biometrics authentication?
"Experts recommend that companies use multiple types of authentication simultaneously and escalate quickly if they see warning signs. 
For example, if the fingerprint is a match but the face isn't, or the account is being accessed from an unusual location at an unusual time, 
it might be time to switch to a backup authentication method or a second communication channel."

##### Our data security
"Today, smartphone hardware security modules are used to provide security for Apple Pay, 
Google Pay and Samsung Payas well as to authenticate third-party applications. 
PayPal, for example, can use a phone's biometric sensor for authentication without PayPal ever seeing the actual biometric data itself. 
Square Cash, Venmo, Dropbox and many banking apps and password management apps leverage this authentication mechanism as well."



## The Future of biometrics
https://recfaces.com/articles/biometric-trends - An article about the usefulness of biometrics now and in the future 

##### Potential uses of biometrics:
Mobile Payment & Online Banking - Biometric data used to identify users (facial recognition and retinal scans) is one of biometric trends in global Internet banking.

Immigration Services - Face recognition technologies and fingerprints are used for passenger boarding and for baggage check-in.

Covering Government Needs - used for border control and counter-terrorism purposes. Used by law enforcement agencies to identify a person with a high degree of accuracy.

Staff Management - Besides this, using biometrics to identify employees can increase employee accountability, which will directly lead to increased productivity.

Health Care and Social Assistance -  Biometric identification of patients optimizes the treatment process and virtually eliminates the possibility of errors.
